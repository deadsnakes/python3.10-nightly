Use ``_freeze_importlib`` to generate code for the ``__hello__`` module.
This approach ensures the code matches the interpreter version.  Previously,
PYTHON_FOR_REGEN was used to generate the code, which might be wrong.  The
marshal format for code objects has changed with bpo-42246, commit 877df851.
Update the code and the expected code sizes in ctypes test_frozentable.
