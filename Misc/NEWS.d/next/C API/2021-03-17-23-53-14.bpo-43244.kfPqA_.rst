Remove the ``symtable.h`` header file and the undocumented functions:

* ``PyST_GetScope()``
* ``PySymtable_Build()``
* ``PySymtable_BuildObject()``
* ``PySymtable_Free()``
* ``Py_SymtableString()``
* ``Py_SymtableStringObject()``

The ``Py_SymtableString()`` function was part the stable ABI by mistake but it
could not be used, because the ``symtable.h`` header file was excluded from the
limited C API.

The Python :mod:`symtable` module remains available and is unchanged.

Patch by Victor Stinner.
