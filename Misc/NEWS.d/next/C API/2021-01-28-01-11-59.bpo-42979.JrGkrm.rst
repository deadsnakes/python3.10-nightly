When Python is built in debug mode (with C assertions), calling a type slot
like ``sq_length`` (``__len__()`` in Python) now fails with a fatal error if
the slot succeeded with an exception set, or failed with no exception set. The
error message contains the slot, the type name, and the current exception (if
an exception is set). Patch by Victor Stinner.
