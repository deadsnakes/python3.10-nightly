Remove ``ast.h``, ``asdl.h``, and ``Python-ast.h`` header files.
These functions were undocumented and excluded from the limited C API.
Most names defined by these header files were not prefixed by ``Py`` and so
could create names conflicts. For example, ``Python-ast.h`` defined a ``Yield``
macro which was conflict with the ``Yield`` name used by the Windows
``<winbase.h>`` header.
Use the Python :mod:`ast` module instead.
