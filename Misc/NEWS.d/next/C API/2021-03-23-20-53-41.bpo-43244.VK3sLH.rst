Remove the compiler and parser functions using ``struct _mod`` type, because
the public AST C API was removed:

* ``PyAST_Compile()``
* ``PyAST_CompileEx()``
* ``PyAST_CompileObject()``
* ``PyFuture_FromAST()``
* ``PyFuture_FromASTObject()``
* ``PyParser_ASTFromFile()``
* ``PyParser_ASTFromFileObject()``
* ``PyParser_ASTFromFilename()``
* ``PyParser_ASTFromString()``
* ``PyParser_ASTFromStringObject()``

These functions were undocumented and excluded from the limited C API.
Patch by Victor Stinner.
