The limited C API is now supported if Python is built in debug mode (if the
``Py_DEBUG`` macro is defined). In the limited C API, the :c:func:`Py_INCREF`
and :c:func:`Py_DECREF` functions are now implemented as opaque function calls,
rather than accessing directly the :c:member:`PyObject.ob_refcnt` member, if
Python is built in debug mode and the ``Py_LIMITED_API`` macro targets Python
3.10 or newer. It became possible to support the limited C API in debug mode
because the :c:type:`PyObject` structure is the same in release and debug mode
since Python 3.8 (see :issue:`36465`).

The limited C API is still not supported in the ``--with-trace-refs`` special
build (``Py_TRACE_REFS`` macro).
