Each interpreter now its has own free lists, singletons and caches:

* Free lists: float, tuple, list, dict, frame, context,
  asynchronous generator, MemoryError.
* Singletons: empty tuple, empty bytes string, empty Unicode string,
  single byte character, single Unicode (latin1) character.
* Slice cache.

They are no longer shared by all interpreters.
