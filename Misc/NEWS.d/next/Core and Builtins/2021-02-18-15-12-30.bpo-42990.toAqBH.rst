The :data:`types.FunctionType` constructor now inherits the current builtins if
the *globals* dictionary has no ``"__builtins__"`` key, rather than using
``{"None": None}`` as builtins: same behavior as :func:`eval` and :func:`exec`
functions. Defining a function with ``def function(...): ...`` in Python is
not affected, globals cannot be overriden with this syntax: it also inherits
the current builtins.
