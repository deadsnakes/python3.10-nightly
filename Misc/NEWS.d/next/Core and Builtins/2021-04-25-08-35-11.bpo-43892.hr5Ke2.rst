Match patterns now use new dedicated AST nodes (``MatchValue``,
``MatchSingleton``, ``MatchSequence``, ``MatchStar``, ``MatchMapping``,
``MatchClass``) rather than reusing expression AST nodes. ``MatchAs`` and
``MatchOr`` are now defined as pattern nodes rather than as expression nodes.
Patch by Nick Coghlan.
