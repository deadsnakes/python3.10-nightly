Add a radix tree based memory map to track in-use obmalloc arenas. Use to
replace the old implementation of address_in_range(). The radix tree
approach makes it easy to increase pool sizes beyond the OS page size.
Boosting the pool and arena size allows obmalloc to handle a significantly
higher percentage of requests from its ultra-fast paths.

It also has the advantage of eliminating the memory unsanitary behavior of
the previous address_in_range(). The old address_in_range() was marked with
the annotations _Py_NO_SANITIZE_ADDRESS, _Py_NO_SANITIZE_THREAD, and
_Py_NO_SANITIZE_MEMORY. Those annotations are no longer needed.

To disable the radix tree map, set a preprocessor flag as follows:
`-DWITH_PYMALLOC_RADIX_TREE=0`.
