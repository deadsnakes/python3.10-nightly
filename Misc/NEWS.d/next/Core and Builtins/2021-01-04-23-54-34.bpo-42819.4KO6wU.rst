:mod:`readline`: Explicitly disable bracketed paste in the interactive
interpreter, even if it's set in the inputrc, is enabled by default (eg GNU
Readline 8.1), or a user calls ``readline.read_init_file()``. The Python REPL
has not implemented bracketed paste support. Also, bracketed mode writes the
``"\x1b[?2004h"`` escape sequence into stdout which causes test failures in
applications that don't support it. It can still be explicitly enabled by
calling ``readline.parse_and_bind("set enable-bracketed-paste on")``. Patch by
Dustin Rodrigues.
