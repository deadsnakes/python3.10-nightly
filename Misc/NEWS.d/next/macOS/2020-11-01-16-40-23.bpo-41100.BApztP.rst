Add support for macOS 11 and Apple Silicon systems.

It is now possible to build "Universal 2" binaries using
"--enable-universalsdk --with-universal-archs=universal2".

Binaries build on later macOS versions can be deployed back to older
versions (tested up to macOS 10.9), when using the correct deployment
target. This is tested using Xcode 11 and later.
