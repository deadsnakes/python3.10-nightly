Fix configure error when building on macOS 11.
Note that the current Python release was released
shortly after the first developer preview of macOS
11 (Big Sur); there are other known issues with
building and running on the developer preview.
Big Sur is expected to be fully supported in a
future bugfix release of Python 3.8.x and with 3.9.0.
