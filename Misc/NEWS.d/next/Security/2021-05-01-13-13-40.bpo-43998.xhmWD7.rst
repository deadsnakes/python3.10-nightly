The :mod:`ssl` module sets more secure cipher suites defaults. Ciphers
without forward secrecy and with SHA-1 MAC are disabled by default. Security
level 2 prohibits weak RSA, DH, and ECC keys with less than 112 bits of
security. :class:`~ssl.SSLContext` defaults to minimum protocol version TLS
1.2. Settings are based on Hynek Schlawack's research.
