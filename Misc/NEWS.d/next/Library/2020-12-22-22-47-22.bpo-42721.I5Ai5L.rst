When simple query dialogs (:mod:`tkinter.simpledialog`), message boxes
(:mod:`tkinter.messagebox`) or color choose dialog
(:mod:`tkinter.colorchooser`) are created without arguments *master* and
*parent*, and the default root window is not yet created, and
:func:`~tkinter.NoDefaultRoot` was not called, a new temporal
hidden root window will be created automatically. It will not be set as the
default root window and will be destroyed right after closing the dialog
window. It will help to use these simple dialog windows in programs which
do not need other GUI.
