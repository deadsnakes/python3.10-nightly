:func:`time.perf_counter()` on Windows and :func:`time.monotonic()` on macOS
are now system-wide. Previously, they used an offset computed at startup to
reduce the precision loss caused by the float type. Use
:func:`time.perf_counter_ns()` and :func:`time.monotonic_ns()` added in Python
3.7 to avoid this precision loss.
