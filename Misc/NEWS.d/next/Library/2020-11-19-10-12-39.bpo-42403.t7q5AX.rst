Simplify the :mod:`importlib` external bootstrap code:
``importlib._bootstrap_external`` now uses regular imports to import builtin
modules. When it is imported, the builtin :func:`__import__()` function is
already fully working and so can be used to import builtin modules like
:mod:`sys`. Patch by Victor Stinner.
