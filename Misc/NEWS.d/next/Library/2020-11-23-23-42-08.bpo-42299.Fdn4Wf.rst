Removed the ``formatter`` module, which was deprecated in Python 3.4.
It is somewhat obsolete, little used, and not tested. It was originally
scheduled to be removed in Python 3.6, but such removals were delayed until
after Python 2.7 EOL. Existing users should copy whatever classes they use
into their code. Patch by Dong-hee Na and and Terry J. Reedy.
