Add :func:`inspect.get_annotations`, which safely computes the annotations
defined on an object.  It works around the quirks of accessing the
annotations from various types of objects, and makes very few assumptions
about the object passed in. :func:`inspect.get_annotations` can also
correctly un-stringize stringized annotations.

:func:`inspect.signature`, :func:`inspect.from_callable`, and
:func:`inspect.from_function` now call :func:`inspect.get_annotations`
to retrieve annotations.  This means :func:`inspect.signature`
and :func:`inspect.from_callable` can now un-stringize stringized
annotations, too.
