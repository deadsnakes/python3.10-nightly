In ``importlib.metadata``: -  ``EntryPoint`` objects now expose a ``.dist``
object referencing the ``Distribution`` when constructed from a
``Distribution``. - Add support for package discovery under package
normalization rules. - The object returned by ``metadata()`` now has a
formally-defined protocol called ``PackageMetadata`` with declared support
for the ``.get_all()`` method. - Synced with importlib_metadata 3.3.
